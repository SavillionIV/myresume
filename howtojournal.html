		<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is Saville, I’ve been journaling for personal use for 20+ years at the time of writing this rule book. The contents herein are what I follow to write my journals. The first few topics go over the types, how to’s and rules of how I construct my Journals. Over the years I have tried various</br>
			One thing you might consider when journaling is to chronicle your life. Start a new set of entries by starting a journal, with the first entry writing out a basic life history leading up to the day you started that journal entry; from then on your journal entries should follow the set of rules below.</p>


		<h1>Types of Journals:</h1>
			<p><b>Blogs-</b> Also known as Web Logs, blogs are great for sharing your personal thoughts, ideas and experiences with the world. There are many online outlets you can use, from free to use to forums for fellow journalists.</p>

			<p><b>Vlogs-</b> Vlogs are video recordings you make following the same rules (whatever rule set you follow) as a journal. You can even add these to your blogs. This kind of journaling has the benefit of seeing your own body language that you then could reflect on for later use. Either for personal or social use.</p>

			<p><b>Audio Logs-</b> With a sound recorder, you can make your logs this way as well, again having the option to add it to your blog. These kinds of journals also carry a benefit that could help you improve other areas as well. When replaying entries, listen to the way you talk; are you mumbling, sounding depressed, talking too fast or too slow? We will go over all this and more in the relevant section.</p>

			<p><b>Diaries/Journals-</b> A pen and paper approach to sharing your personal thoughts, ideas and experiences that has a more private option. Meaning you have far more control to whom you share the entries with. The benefit here is that you can improve on your penmanship, whether it’s cursive or print.</p>

			<p><b>News Outlet-</b> There are news outlets that offer a small portion of their paper for you to write in and include in it their next run. These could include personal experiences but often explore thoughts and ideas specifically related to a topic or study, such as; astrology, cooking, science or even a review on an event you went to.</p>

			<p><b>Work Logs-</b> Keeping a log of your contract, completed tasks and project updates not only helps you keep up with what you’ve done, but might cover your ass later on in life.</p>

			<p><b>Dream Journal-</b> Keeping a log of your dreams could help you consciously dissect your subconscious thoughts.</p>

			<p>Hello, my name is Delton Thomas. I am writing this journal to chronicle my life story. I was born in Spanish Fork, Utah on April 1, 1993 to James and Marie Thomas. I have one sister, Alexa and a brother, Xavier; I am the oldest, then it is Alexa, followed by Xavior. All of us were born at the Provo Hospital just 12 miles north of here. We went to the local schools here in Spanish Fork and all graduated. 
			After graduation, I went on to study Medicine at Utah Valley University (UVU) to become a neurosurgeon. As of the date noted in the header, I have my associates degree in Human biology, anatomy, physiology, bio-chemistry and neurology. Currently working on my bachelors, I am currently working at the same hospital I was born in to gain more experience. While I am working on my masters to become a neurosurgeon, I am also minoring in robotics and computer software engineering. What intrigues me about these fields is how such everything interacts. 
			Some of my hobbies include: trading cards, role playing games and building sets. Interests include: hiking, camping, car trips, botany and astrology. Some of my talents include: Being good with people, taking notes and managing priorities.</p>
			<p>Way’s I keep funds in my account are to recycle, utilize reward points, keep up with places that do store credit, invest in companies I believe in -especially those with high dividend yields- and shop at thrift stores.</p>

			<p>Today I am grateful for:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Excellent tutors and guides</li>
				<li>A home to return to</li>
				<li>A loving Finacee</li>
			</ol>
	


			<p>Sincerely, 
				Delton Thomas</p>



Dear Reader,                                     Journal#2                                   Monday, January 2, 2025

	Today, I have discovered that the combination of robotics, software engineering and the human condition, as a whole, have a lot in common. Both software and hardware have to work in candom to operate efficiently. I really do enjoy studying the inner workings of the mind and body. 

	Today I am grateful for:
A home to shelter me from the elements
Food to help keep me energized and healthy
People to talk to and a family to love

	I had an extraordinary interaction earlier with a patient at the hospital. I won’t disclose anything personal as that will violate the HIPPA act, but she pointed out something that shouldn’t be forgotten. She said "The quality of your attention determines the quality of your life." This means that what you choose to focus on shapes your experience more than the circumstances themselves. This got me thinking about both my home and professional life styles. 
	A goal that I have is to buy some land to build a home on and spend the rest of my life with my gorgeous wife and raise a family. Some of the stepping stones I see to make this a reality is to continue my schooling and become successful at being a neurosurgeon. This will provide me the income I need to buy and build on that land. Although, I do plan to keep things as cheap as I can to make the house as self efficient as I can. Solar panels for electricity, a garden for fruits and vegetables, a small shop to perform general maintenance and other small things that won’t require me to call in expensive companies. The money I could save if this would happen will allow me to take my family on more vacations and set money aside for my kids future. 
	Today I have accomplished all of my studies, spent time with my beautiful fiancee, read a book and watched a movie. 
	I had an argument with my fiancee today. It was about not having enough time to spend with her between my studies, work and sleep cycle. While, this is a worthy while of my time, what will I lose if all my time is taken by work and study. But what will I lose if I don’t. I can cut some things out to try and subside for her. 
 
Sincerely,
Delton Thomas


Dear Reader,                              Journal #3                	         Tuesday, January 3, 2025
	I have been thinking about adding herbology into my repertoire of skills. As a medicine man who enjoys camping, hiking and taking road trips it might come in handy to know what effects and benefits would come from the flowers I study. 
	The three things I am grateful for are:
Positive attitudes of others


Dear Reader,                                     Journal #4                            Wednesday, January 4, 2025
Entry #1(06:00)- Good Morning, I just woke up and am currently getting ready for a twelve hour shift at the hospital. Fortunately, there is no school today or tomorrow. I have a half a day of work tomorrow, so I plan to spend half the day tomorrow with Maria. Maybe a walk in the park, go to the mall followed by a dinner/movie combo. 

Three Things I am Grateful For:
Having great people to work with
A great infrastructure
Small favors

	Entry #2(10:30)- I just got onto my first break. It has been a fairly easy start to the day, just some routine rounds. 

	Entry #3(12:30)- It is now lunch and not a lot to report. Although, it goes without saying, “it is the calm before the storm”, it is the middle of the week anything can happen. 

	Entry #4(14:30)- Second break here. My suspicions were confirmed when three ambulances came in with two different types of medical emergencies; two of them were from a severe car pile up, and the other was a home robbery gone wrong. 

	Entry #5(16:30)- Last break for the day. The three victims have been stabilized and we have had a few transfers from a few different elderly care facilities.
 
	Entry #6(22:30)- Final entry for the day, I got home about an hour ago. I re-heated some left overs Maria had cooked for dinner. I’ll leave a recipe in this entry for those who are interested


Galinhada (Brazilian Chicken and Rice)
Galinhada is a hearty, rustic dish from the countryside of Brazil, especially popular in Goiás and Minas Gerais. It’s made with chicken, rice, and vibrant spices—comfort food at its best.

Turmeric or annatto (urucum): 1 tsp (for color and flavor)
Bay leaf: 1
Olive oil: 2–3 tbsp
Fresh parsley or cilantro: chopped, for garnish
Optional:
Green peas or corn: ½ cup (for extra texture and sweetness)
Instructions:
Marinate the Chicken:
Rub the chicken with lime juice, salt, pepper, and half the garlic.
Let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour if you have time.
Brown the Chicken:
In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat.
Brown the chicken pieces on all sides. Remove and set aside.
Sauté the Base:
In the same pot, add onions, bell peppers, and remaining garlic.
Cook until softened, then stir in the tomatoes and turmeric/annatto.
Combine and Simmer:
Return chicken to the pot.
Add the rice, bay leaf, and pour in the chicken broth.
Bring to a boil, then lower to a simmer and cover.
Cook Until Done:
Let it cook on low heat for about 25–30 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked through.
Stir in peas or corn in the last 5 minutes if using.
Serve:
Let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.
Garnish with parsley or cilantro. 
Great With:
A side of fried plantains or salad with hearts of palm
A cold glass of guaraná or a light Brazilian beer

Sincerely,
Delton Thomas
